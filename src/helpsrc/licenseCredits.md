    This librray is wrapped in TS in libStdDev.ts. In future, it might be replaced with [sprintfit](https://github.com/joseluisq/sprintfit)
    which is pure TS, simpler, faster but supports only "%s".

    I might also replace it with Rust println!() style placeholders, i.e. `sprintf("%s: %s", str1, str2)` would become `println("{}: {}, {:?}", any1, any2, complexObjWithToStringMethod)`.
