| Name                              | Type | Default | Remarks |
| --------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------- |
| DEBUG_LEVEL                       | enum | ERROR | Level of output messages in the Script Log (aka Output Log) shown by the script.<br /><br />Unless you are adventurous, do not set it above WARN, i.e. NORMAL, INFO, VERBOSE emita ton of information and might freeze your PC/DOpus.<br /><br />The log can be opened by via:<br />* View -> Output Window<br />* by the command `Set UTILITY=OtherLog,Toggle`<br />* by opening Find, Synchronize, etc. and choosing "Other Log" in the "Utility Panel" dropdown |
| FORCE_REFRESH_AFTER_UPDATE        | boolean | true | Automatically refresh the current lister after changes.<br /><br />It keeps the current selection. |
| MEDIAINFO_PATH                    | string | /programfilesx86/MediaInfo/MediaInfo.exe | Path to MediaInfo portable CLI.<br /><br />It can be downloaded from [https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo/Download/Windows](https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo/Download/Windows) |
| TEMP_FILES_DIR                    | string | %TEMP% | Temporary directory, in which temporary JSON outputs from MediaInfo are stored.<br /><br />They are immediately deleted after a file has been processed.<br /><br />This is ignored in Templess Mode (see below). |
| TEMPLESS_MODE                     | boolean | false | *Experimental:*<br /><br />In this mode, MediaInfo outputs are read into the script without using temporary files.<br /><br />This is a highly experimental feature and uses temporary (volatile) environment variables to pass the data from the command output to DOpus.<br /><br />If you are lucky, it might work just as fast as, if not faster than the normal mode using temp-files. If not, disable it again. |
| TEMPLESS_CHUNK_SIZE               | number | 32768 | Experimental:<br /><br />Determines how big the chunks, i.e. volatile envvar blocks, should be. Windows has certain limitations on command line and envvar lengths. If templess mode works mostly for you, you can increase the value even further.<br /><br />The default value is chosen very conservatively. |
| KEEP_ORIG_MODTS                   | boolean | true | Attaching ADS to files normally changes the *last modification* timestamps of the parent file.<br /><br />* true: The script automatically resets the timestamp to original.<br />* false: The parent files' modification timestamp is changed. |
| CACHE_ENABLED                     | boolean | true | Cache metadata JS objects in memory for unchanged files to speed up process.<br/><br/>The information stored in ADS is usually small, typically ~1 KB per file, but I cannot guarantee how much memory management overhead Windows/WSH/JScript/DOpus put on top of each object. The cache is used only and only if this script runs, i.e. automatically when any of the columns is visible (incl. in InfoTips/Tiles), or if you trigger a command.<br/><br/>To ensure the information is always up-to-date, the following algorithm is used:<br/><br/>* Caching disabled or file is not in cache => read from disk<br/><br/>* File is already in cache => check file's last modification time against the timestamp in cached info<br/> * If different => read from disk<br/> * If same => use cache<br/>* UPDATE command executed (regardless of file was in cache or not) => add to/update cache<br/>* File is already in cache but DELETE command is executed => remove from cache<br/><br/>WARNING:<br/><br/>The cache will fail for one particular scenario:<br/><br/>Say, you have a file and you copy it to another folder. If the copy is processed, its information will be cached. If you delete the copy via DOpus (or some other program), the script will not receive this information automatically. If you copy the original file, which has the exact same file size & modification timestamp, to the same path again, the new copy will have no ADS but the script will still think that the it is the previously processed file and show the information from the cache. Normally this is not a problem for displaying purposes, but if you copy the copy to another drive, it will have no ADS. If you do this, you should either manually update the 2nd copy, or delete the cache to see that the copy has no ADS.<br/><br/>Please keep this in mind.<br/><br/>CAVEATS:<br/><br/>If you keep DOpus open for a long time and handle thousands of small files (only when any of these extra columns is shown), the memory usage of DOpus will increase. This is not a 'memory leak' though, just the script doing what you tell it to: To cache stuff :)<br/><br/>To avoid high mem usage you can manually call the CLEARCACHE command via button, menu... |

These are also used for grouping. For calculation always, the smaller of width/height is taken. Also see RESOLUTION_APPEND_VERTICAL. <br /><br />The comparison is always <= (less or equal), i.e.<br />*actual resolution <= config values*<br /><br />Alternatively, you can use SD, HD-Ready, HD, UHD, 4K, 8K, etc.<br /><br />*Example: A file with with 640x480 resolution, will be shown as 480p.* |

These are also used for grouping.<br /><br />The comparison is always <= (less or equal), i.e.<br />*actual duration <= config values*<br/><br />Some raw files extracted from movie containers, notably raw AAC (not M4A), raw DTS, raw Atmos are reported as having a 0 duration by MediaInfo. But if the file definitely has audio, you can recognize this as well.<br /><br/> \u2260 is the Unicode 'not equal' sign.<br/> <br />If the file has no audio track at all, this is grouped automatically under 'No Audio', no need to define it here.<br/><br />Also note that some values like 'Over 1h' depend on preceeding key's value |

Some formats like Musepack, raw DTS report an audio track but not the channel count, sorted between 0 & 1.<br/><br />Some alternatives for 0:<br />* "0": "0 (no audio)"<br/>* "0": "0 (n/a)"<br/>* "0": "0"<br/>If you use "0": "" the value 0 will be shown as empty string as well, which impacts sorting.<br /><br />Some alternatives for X:<br />* "X": "> 0",<br />* "X": "≠ 0" |
